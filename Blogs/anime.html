        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Anime watchers are increasing day by day and it has been noted that the people who watch anime are more likely to enjoy the TV shows with wide variety of Genre. 
        Many of my friends are quite obsessed with the anime industry. I could not understand the reason because, I was of the understanding that anime was animation and animation is meant for children. So, I decided to check it out myself to see what is so interesting about anime that even adults obsess over it. After watching a few anime shows like Naruto, One Piece, Full Metal, I was able to see the reason why anime appeals to many.  Anime is fun, dramatic, and intense and caters to all ages. But there are a lot of misconceptions related to anime. So, let us begin by understanding what anime is. According to the Japanese culture, anime means any animated cartoon regardless of its origin. </p>
